Current behaviour:

All data is stored in txt file. Prog does not use any DB for storing data. Prog uses the file to read the data every time it runs. Prog reads all the data from the file, calculates average sum for costs for day and put it as the last line in the file. After that creates (if there is no such file for the moment) file for average month's costs or append existing one in a certain way (TBD)

Format of file:

Regular flat file with ',' (comma) delimetered values:
Product category (CAT),Product name (NME),cost (COST)




Things to do:

1. Implement defining all parameters in config file and reading this config at the start of prog.
2. Need to completely redesign the model as db came to the scene.
    2.1 As quick decision, 3 layer model can be used:
        - input
        - transformation
        - loading to db
