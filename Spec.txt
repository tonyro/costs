Current behaviour:
Prog is devided into 3 modules:
 - 1st one simply loads file names into DB (arrivals table) that are in folder but not in DB;
 - 2nd one (planned to) read DB (arrivals table) for unprocessed files (PROCESSED_FLAG = 'N') and load data from such files to DB. After completion it sets PROCESSED_FLAG to 'Y';
 - 3rd one (planned to) use DB to generate several reports for costs.

Format of file:

Regular flat file with ',' (comma) delimetered values:
Product category (CAT),Product name (NME),cost (COST)




Things to do:

1. Implement defining all parameters in config file and reading this config at the start of prog.
2. Need to completely redesign the model as db came to the scene.
    2.1 As quick decision, 3 layer model can be used:
        - input
        - transformation
        - loading to db
3. Module to load unprocessed filenames into DB is currently totally hardcoded. So it's vital to
    refactor it for using global config file to get parameters.
        

Flow to pick files to process:
1. Get list of file names in the folder.
2. Get list of file names in db (files_arrivals_control).
3. Get the difference of these two lists and make a new listfrom that.
4. Process all files in list of difference one by one.
